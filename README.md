# Prepayment Accounting Entry Generator

This Python-based solution automates the generation of prepayment schedules and their corresponding accounting entries. It helps businesses properly amortize prepaid expenses (e.g., insurance, webhosting, software) across months.

---

## Overview

When a company pays upfront for services that span multiple months, the expense must be recognized over time. This tool:

- Builds a **monthly amortization schedule** for each prepaid item.
- Generates **accounting entries** for each relevant month-end.
- Allows filtering by **item name** and/or **month**.
- Exports output in **excel** format

## ‚úÖ How to Use

### 1. Prepare your data

Create a CSV file named `prepaid_items.csv` with the following structure:

```csv
Item,Invoice Number,Invoice Amount,Duration Months,Start Month
Webhosting,46248,10000,12,Jan-24
Insurance,89017,1200,12,Apr-24
Software,34567,3600,12,Mar-24
Hosting,12345,2400,12,Jun-24
```

> You may rename the file, but make sure to update `config.py`.

---

### 2. Configure the script

Open `config.py` and edit the fields:

```python
AS_AT_MONTH = "Oct-24"        # Used to calculate remaining balance
START_PERIOD = "Jan-24"       # Start of the schedule
END_PERIOD = "Dec-25"         # End of the schedule

ITEM_FILTER = "Webhosting"    # e.g., "Webhosting" or leave "" for all items
MONTH_FILTER = "May-24"       # e.g., "May-24" or leave "" for all months

INPUT_FILE = "prepaid_items.csv"
```

- Leave `ITEM_FILTER` or `MONTH_FILTER` as `""` to include all.

For example, if I want to retrieve all the accounting entries of May-24, set `ITEM_FILTER = ""` and `MONTH_FILTER = "May-24"`.
Similarly, if I want to retrieve all accounting entries of a particular item/service, eg Insurance, set `ITEM_FILTER = "Insurance"` and `MONTH_FILTER = ""`.

---

### 3. Run the script

From your terminal, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will create:

- `output/prepayment_schedule_flexible.xlsx`  
  (with full amortization schedule and accounting entries)

- `output/entries_<item>_<month>.xlsx`  
  (filtered based on your `config.py`)
